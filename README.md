# Analysis-of-Otto-Diesel-and-Dual-Gas-Cycles
MATLAB project for analyzing Otto, Diesel, and Dual gas cycles by calculating efficiency, torque, net work output, compression ratio, cutoff ratio, and mean effective pressure. The analysis is supported with Pâ€“V diagrams and performance graphs, including thermal efficiency vs compression ratio, thermal efficiency vs cutoff ratio, and stroke vs efficiency, providing a comprehensive visualization of cycle behavior.
