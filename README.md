# Analysis-of-Otto-Diesel-and-Dual-Gas-Cycles
MATLAB-based analysis of Otto, Diesel, and Dual gas cycles, computing key parameters such as efficiency, torque, net work output, compression ratio, cutoff ratio, and mean effective pressure. Includes visualization through Pâ€“V diagrams and performance plots for thermal efficiency versus compression ratio, cutoff ratio, and stroke.
